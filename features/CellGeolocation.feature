Feature: Cell Geolocation API

    GNSS fixes will be stored with the cell id
    so that the UI can show an approximate tracker location
    based on the cell id even if a device has no current GNSS fix

    Background:

        Given I am run after the "Connect a tracker" feature
        And I am run after the "Login" feature
        And I am run after the "Device: Update Shadow" feature

    Scenario: Device enters a cell

        Given I store "$floor($random() * 100000000)" into "cellId"
        And I store "$random() * 90" into "lat"
        And I store "$random() * 180" into "lng"
        Then the tracker "{trackerId}" updates its reported state with
