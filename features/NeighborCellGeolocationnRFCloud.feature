Feature: nRF Cloud Neighbor Cell Geolocation

    Optionally, device locations can be resolved by the nRF Cloud API using the neighboring cell measurement reports
    Note: nRF Cloud's geolocation API does not distinguish between different network modes.

    Contexts:

    | nw    | apiNw |
    | ltem  | lte   |

    Background:

        This enques a mock response on the mock HTTP API the stack is configure
        to use for the nRF Cloud integration

        Given I am run after the "Store neighboring cell measurement reports" feature
        And the endpoint is "{apiEndpoint}"
        And the Authorization header is "Bearer {accessToken}"
        And the Content-Type header is "application/json; charset=utf-8"
        And I store a random number between 0 and 20000 into "accuracy"
        And I store a random float between -90 and 90 into "lat"
        And I store a random float between -180 and 180 into "lng"
        And I enqueue this mock HTTP API response with status code 200 for a POST request to api.nrfcloud.com/v1/location/cell
